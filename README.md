# Pocket
[![Project Status: Inactive â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state but is no longer being actively developed; support/maintenance will be provided as time allows.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/inactive.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#inactive)

This app mimics the functionality of the popular [Pocket](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro&hl=en_IN&gl=US) app
which is available to download in the play store. To try out this app you need to use the latest version of [Android Studio Arctic Fox](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview). The main aim of this app was to test the applicability of compose in a small sized offline app. There is no intention of releasing this app to the play store. Also note that, eventhough firebase authentication is used, the saved items for each user are not stored in the cloud. The app has reached a 'stable' and 'usable' state. But, testing the app was not the main focus. Hence, bugs are bound to exist.

### Top bar (API < 29)
The top bar will display the option to change the theme if, and only if, the device' current android
version doesn't support dark mode.If it supports dark mode, then the theme of the app will match the
current system theme.
